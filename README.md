# WebProject-CampesReservation
Hi there,
In this project, users will be shown the list of campsites that I get from an API. The user can filter the campsites by the number of available nights and equipment they have. After that, the user can add their reservation and a summary of their reservation with the total amount to pay will be shown to the user and all the changes to the availability of campsites will be saved in the firebase.
Hope you enjoy it.
